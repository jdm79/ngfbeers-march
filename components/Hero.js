            Unlike pretty much all "gluten-free beer" on the UK (and rest of the European) market, 
            the companies listed here do not use barley or wheat in any of their beers. 
            In Australia, Canada and the United States, gluten-free beers are those beers made without gluten-containing ingredients.
            Those beers made with barley and then "deglutenised" are called gluten-reduced beers. 
       
            In Europe we call these beers gluten-free, even though the latest scientific research shows that 
            the deglutenisation process does not work and that testing beer for gluten with the ELISA5 
            test is inaccurate.

            We have listed the European companies, but will be adding the rest of the world soon.
